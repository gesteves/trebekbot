## Installation

Unfortunately, jService.io, which is the third-party service from which Trebekbot sourced the questions and answers, has shut down permanently. As such, Trebekbot no longer works and cannot be installed. Thanks for playing!

## Usage

After installing the bot, invite it into one or more channels with `/invite @trebekbot`. Pro-tip: Create a new channel (for example, #jeopardy) just for this purpose, to avoid creating a huge distraction in other channels.

After that, simply mentioning "@trebekbot" will start a new game in the current channel.

You can also say:

* "@trebekbot my score" to see your current score
* "@trebekbot leaderboard" or "@trebekbot scoreboard" to see the top scores
* "@trebekbot help" to see a list of commands
