# trebekbot

A Jeopardy! bot for Slack, powered by the [jService](http://jservice.io/) API. Sets up a perpetual game of Jeorpardy! in your Slack channels.

## Requirements

You'll need a [Slack](https://slack.com) account, obviously, and a free [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account to host the bot. You'll also need to be able to set up new integrations in Slack; if you're not able to do this, contact someone with admin access in your organization.

## Installation

1. Set up a Slack outgoing webhook at https://slack.com/services/new/outgoing-webhook. Make sure to pick a trigger word, such as `trebekbot`. You might also want to set this up in a single room, if you value your team's productivity.

2. Grab the token for the outgoing webhook you just created, and a Slack API token, which you can get from https://api.slack.com/web.

3. Click this button to set up your Heroku app: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)   
If you'd rather do it manually, then just clone this repo, set up a Heroku app with Redis Cloud (the free level is more than enough for this), and deploy trebekbot there. Make sure to set up the config variables in
[.env.example](https://github.com/gesteves/trebekbot/blob/master/.env.example) in your Heroku app's settings screen.

4. Point the outgoing webhook to https://[YOUR-HEROKU-APP].herokuapp.com

## Usage

* `trebekbot jeopardy me`: starts a round of Jeopardy! trebekbot will pick a category and score for you.
* `trebekbot what/who/where/when is/are [answer]`: sends an answer. Remember, responses must be in the form of a question!
* `trebekbot what's my score`: shows your current score.
* `trebekbot show the leaderboard`: shows the current top scores.
* `trebekbot show the loserboard`: shows the current bottom scores.
